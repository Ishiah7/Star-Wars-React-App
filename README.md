This is a React Single-Page Web Application. The project wraps around the SWAPI API which provides the world's first quantified and programmatically-accessible data source for all the data from the Star Wars canon universe! The application is mobile-friendly so give it a shot. The application is hosted using Heroku using their free-tier subscription.
